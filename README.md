## Scripts

### Executor

Executor is a versatile tool that I use frequently. It allows me to perform various tasks such as opening websites, applications, and files, running scripts, and more. It essentially serves as a convenient menu for executing different actions.

Using it, I can conveniently search Google and YouTube directly from the taskbar, as well as quickly access frequently used configuration files.
### NextEvent

NextEvent script is designed to enhance my productivity by retrieving and displaying my upcoming calendar event on the i3 bar. With this script, I no longer need to constantly check my calendar to stay updated on my schedule.
